# Album Collection based on indexedDB
## A simple interface for keeping track of your albums (cd/vynil)
In the initial version, it consists of two parts. The first part is data entry fields - where the data for the album is entered and the second part is a table that automatically shows the given data. Data can be updated for each field, and field delete is also enabled.
